# SF Fire Risk

This project attempts to model and acquire data from SF OpenData - and other sources - to predict the relative risk of fire in San Franciscoâ€™s buildings and public spaces.

The mapping software will allow the user to type in an address and see fire-related risks and incidences around their area, as well as provide recommendations by fire safety experts in cases where there may be a high enough score to warrant preventive actions.

This project is modeled after Data Science for Social Good's (DSSG) Firebird Project in Atlanta, GA. Consultation is occasionally provided by members of the DSSG and former members of the Atlanta project.
